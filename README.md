# google-homepage-v2
My second attempt at the google homepage task for The Odin Project.

This is a replica site of the google.com homepage.

It will include everything that is included on that webpage and will be: 
 - Responsive
 - Accurate

Some of the skills that I will have demonstrated after completion of this project include: 
 - Basic HTML and CSS
 - Knowledge of how to use flexbox and CSS grid to my advantage
 - Knowledge on how to use Brave DevTools well and to my advantage
